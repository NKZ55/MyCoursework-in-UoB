# MyCoursework-in-UoB

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Business Analytics course at the **University of Bath**. This repository consists of **courseworks** through the programme.

Original datasets are provided by _professors_ from the UoB.

This is a groupwork, I was in charge of the VBA code.

This is not an Excel Solver, but more focus on the algorithm of heuristics itself, so it's not user-friendly. It will take about 5 minutes to run the algorithms for each instance, and most of the time is consumed by the metaheuristic algorithm (5 minutes).

Please click the **main** button to see the branches.
